## Background

I am an international student from India. I am looking forward to build a strong foundation in software engineering through this course. Super excited to work with everyone!

## Interests

I love reading mystery thrillers. One of my favorites is Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None'. Some of my comfort shows are Friends, B99, Modern Family and Gilmore Girls. I love taking pictures of nature. Here's a picture of a sunset at Sunset Cliffs in San Diego.
